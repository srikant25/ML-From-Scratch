# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of foundational **Machine Learning algorithms** from scratch using Python and NumPy. It is organized into two main categories:

- ðŸ§  Supervised Learning
- ðŸ§© Clustering Techniques (Unsupervised Learning)

Each algorithm is implemented with a focus on conceptual clarity and code readability, making this a great resource for beginners and intermediate learners.
