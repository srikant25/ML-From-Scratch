# ðŸ§  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on FashionMNIST

This project contains an implementation of both **GAN** and **Conditional GAN (CGAN)** built from scratch using **TensorFlow/Keras** and applied to the **FashionMNIST dataset**. The aim is to understand the core concepts of generative modeling by building everything without using high-level APIs.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Included?

### âœ… GAN (Vanilla GAN)
- Generator and Discriminator built from scratch
- Binary Cross Entropy loss
- Training loop from scratch
- Results visualized over training epochs

### âœ… Conditional GAN (CGAN)
- Label-conditioned Generator and Discriminator
- Label embedding for both models
- Side-by-side image generation based on class
- Clear improvement over Vanilla GAN
