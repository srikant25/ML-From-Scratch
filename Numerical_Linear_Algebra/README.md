## ðŸ“˜ Algorithms Implemented

### 1. **Cholesky Decomposition**
- Factorizes a symmetric, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its transpose.
- Useful for solving systems of linear equations efficiently.

### 2. **Gauss-Seidel Algorithm**
- An iterative method for solving a system of linear equations.
- Converges faster than Jacobi in most cases.

### 3. **Jacobi Method**
- A simple iterative technique for diagonal-dominant matrices.
- Good for educational demonstration and initial approximations.

### 4. **Infinity Norm (â€–Â·â€–âˆž)**
- Calculates the maximum absolute row sum of a matrix.
- Useful for convergence analysis and error estimation.

### 5. **Zero Norm (â€–Â·â€–â‚€)**
- Counts the number of non-zero elements in a vector.
- Common in sparse matrix analysis and regularization.

### 6. **LU Factorization (without Partial Pivoting)**
- Decomposes a square matrix into a product of a lower (L) and an upper (U) triangular matrix.
- Does not involve row exchanges.

### 7. **LU Factorization (with Partial Pivoting)**
- Enhances numerical stability by including row swaps.
- Recommended for general use.

### 8. **Forward and Backward Substitution**
- Solves linear systems where the coefficient matrix is triangular.
- Used post LU or Cholesky decomposition.

### 9. **Positive Definite Matrix Check**
- Verifies whether a matrix is symmetric and all eigenvalues are positive.
- Required condition for Cholesky decomposition.

### 10. **Thomas Algorithm**
- Efficient solver for tridiagonal systems of equations.
- Linear time complexity: O(n).

### 11. **Tridiagonal Matrix Algorithm (TDMA)**
- Another name for the Thomas Algorithm.
- Common in numerical PDEs and finite difference methods.
